# PiDo.AI 🚀

**PiDo.AI** is a powerful, node-based Edge AI Vision platform designed specifically for industrial automation and edge computing (e.g., Raspberry Pi with Hailo-8L accelerators). It allows users to visually design, deploy, and monitor real-time AI pipelines through an intuitive drag-and-drop interface, bridging the gap between hardware (GPIO, RS485), computer vision models (YOLO, custom `.hef`), and logical edge processing.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (v18 or higher)
- **Python** (v3.11 or higher)
- **Hardware (Optional but recommended):** Raspberry Pi 4/5 with a Hailo AI Accelerator module.
- **HailoRT:** Ensure Hailo drivers and PCIe configurations are properly set up on the host machine.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CytronTH/pido.ai.git
   cd pido.ai
   ```

2. **Frontend Setup:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

3. **Backend Setup:**
   ```bash
   cd ../backend
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Application

PiDo.AI provides two startup scripts tailored for production deployments and active development:

#### 🚀 Production Mode (Recommended for End Users)
Optimized for Raspberry Pi deployment. Serves both Frontend UI and Backend APIs on a single port (`8000`), minimizing RAM consumption:

```bash
chmod +x start-prod.sh
./start-prod.sh
```

- **Web UI & API:** `http://localhost:8000` (or `http://<raspberry-pi-ip>:8000`)
- **MediaMTX Streams:** Port `8554` (RTSP), `8889` (WebRTC WHEP)

#### 🛠️ Development Mode (For Developers)
Runs Vite hot-reloading development server alongside the backend:

```bash
chmod +x start.sh
./start.sh
```

- **Frontend UI (Hot Reload):** `http://localhost:5173`
- **Backend API:** `http://localhost:8000`

---

## ⚙️ Configuration & Environment
You can configure environment variables by creating a `.env` file in the `backend` directory:
```ini
# backend/.env
HOST=0.0.0.0
PORT=8000
MEDIAMTX_API_URL=http://localhost:9997
HAILO_DEVICE_ID=0000:01:00.0
```

---

## 🚑 Troubleshooting
- **Hailo PCIe Device Not Found:** Ensure the HailoRT driver is installed and the device is detected via `lspci | grep Hailo`.
- **MediaMTX Streams Failing:** Check if port `8554` or `8889` is already in use.
- **WebSocket Disconnects:** Ensure the frontend points to the correct backend IP if accessing from a different machine on the local network.

---

## 🔧 Workflow Guide

1. **Create a Project:** Start by creating a new project in the Home Screen.
2. **Build a Pipeline:** Go to the Pipeline Builder, drag an `Input Node` (e.g., Camera stream), connect it to an `AI Node` (select a model like YOLOv8), and route the output to a `Dashboard Video Node` or `Hardware Node` (e.g., Digital Output / LED).
3. **Set ROIs (Region of Interest):** Double-click AI nodes to define specific inspection zones on the stream.
4. **Deploy & Monitor:** Hit "Save & Deploy". Switch to the **Live Dashboard** tab to monitor inferences, latency, and hardware trigger events in real-time.

### 🛡️ Offline-First & Air-Gapped Capabilities (Roadmap)
- [ ] **Local Data & Image Storage Architecture:**
  - **SQLite (WAL Mode):** On-device, zero-setup database for high-speed logging of inference metadata (JSON) and system events.
  - **Filesystem Snapshot Storage:** Storing image snapshots directly to the local filesystem (with file paths saved to SQLite) to minimize SD card wear and maintain database performance.
- [ ] **Zero-Touch USB Auto-Deploy:** Auto-load pipelines and models via USB stick for mass deployment without UI interaction.
- [ ] **Physical & Local Alerts:** Direct GPIO Tower Light controls, local network Modbus TCP, and SMS module integration (no internet required).
- [ ] **Local Access Point (Hotspot):** Built-in AP mode for direct tablet/laptop connection without factory Wi-Fi.
- [ ] **mDNS Discovery (`pido-ai.local`):** Local network auto-discovery.
- [ ] **Air-Gapped Firmware Updates:** Upload `.tar.gz` system updates directly via the Web UI.
- [ ] **Self-Hosted Documentation:** Fully offline, bundled interactive tutorials and node documentation.

### 📅 Future Work
- [ ] **User Management & RBAC (Role-Based Access Control):**
  - **Multi-tier roles (Admin, Operator, Viewer):** Admins have full access, Operators can acknowledge alerts and view dashboards but cannot edit pipelines, and Viewers have read-only access.
  - **Audit Logging & Accountability:** Track user actions such as pipeline modifications, system overrides, and alert acknowledgments for factory compliance.
  - **Personalized Dashboards (Layouts):** Save distinct widget layouts per user account (e.g., Admins see system resources, Operators see video feeds).
  - **Targeted Alert Routing:** Dispatch alerts via Line/Email to specific users based on their roles, shifts, or assigned production lines.
  - **Multi-Tenancy / Workspaces:** Isolate projects and pipelines between different departments (e.g., QC team vs Security team).
  - **Secure API Integration (API Keys):** Require user-bound API Keys for external system (SCADA/ERP) integrations to prevent unauthorized access.
- [ ] Support for multi-camera parallel pipeline execution
- [ ] Modbus Industrial Protocol integrations
